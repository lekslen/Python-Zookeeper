## Project Description

There are many animals in the zoo, and all of them need care.  
They must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for a large zoo, so a program was created to make things easier.  

With this program, zookeepers can ‚Äúswitch on the camera‚Äù in different habitats and check on the animals.
